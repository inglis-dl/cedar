====================================================================================================
1.1.3
====================================================================================================

* Workflow improvement
  - changed completed column from boolean to tri-state enumerated value with states:
    incomplete - a test does not meet the minimum technical requirements for completion
    complete - the test meets the minimum technical requirements for completion
    submitted - the test meets the minimum technical requirements for completion and is finished
    being worked on by the user

====================================================================================================
1.1.2
====================================================================================================

* Language handling revision
  - remove the dependence of typists' language restrictions on test_entry inputs
  - a typists language restrictions are now used solely to determine which participant
    they are assigned during an assignment request
  - participants with no language preference are assigned the default service language (en)
  - add linkage from the cedar test_entry table to the cenozo language table so that
    supervisors and administrators can control by language which words are permitted for
    data entry
  - add new test_entry operations: add language, delete language, new language

* Cognate bug fix
  - handling of cognates (words of different languages spelled the same) is accomplished
    by underlining all non-english (i.e., french) words in text input fields

* Workflow improvement
  - assignment reassign procedure is now simplified to changing the user in the assignment record
    to that selected from a drop down list of candidate users (i.e., all users with compatible
    language restrictions who are not already assigned to the participant)
  - assignments can only be reassigned if they are not complete
  - tests can be returned to typists with a note from test views or adjudications

* Performance improvement
  - add ON DELETE CASCADE to test_entry_note (already present for all test_entry daughter tables:
    e.g. test_entry_confirmation) so that when test_entry records are deleted linked
    records are deleted intrinsically

* Comprehensive recording load script
  - created a php script to scan the storage system for new UID's and then load
    those into the cedar recording table

* Bilingual assignment bug fix
  - sibling assignments were not being awarded to users with identical language settings
    as those of the first assignment's test entry language usage

====================================================================================================
1.1.1
====================================================================================================

* Workflow improvements
  - add test_entry return operation so that a test can be deferred back to a typist
    at the adjudication stage by administrators or supervisors

    bottom of adjudication pages

====================================================================================================
1.1.0
====================================================================================================

  - recordings are stored on disk according to visit, participant UID, and cognitive variable
    name as stored and identified in Opal (eg., 001/A123456/COG_ALPTME_REC2_COM.wav )

* Workflow improvements
  - implement new deferral process using expanded deferred states: NULL, requested, pending,
    resolved
  - a typist requests a deferral setting the deferred status of a test to "requested"
  - administrators review and change the deferred status of a test in the test_entry view to "pending"
  - a test's deferred status changes to "resolved" after the first typist edit that completes the test
  - participant allocation is restricted on a complete by complete assigment basis by checking
    during assignment request if there is a sibling assignment, and if so, that the sibling
    assignment has all tests completed

====================================================================================================
1.0.2
====================================================================================================

* Adding assignment reassign

* Adding new "collection" feature
  - collections are arbitrary groups of participant
  - can be locked so that editing is restricted to a list of specified users only
  - restrict select reports by collection remains to be implemented

* Adding assignment delete
  - add assignment delete operation
  - allow administrators to delete open assignments
  - assignments cannot be deleted if
    1) their end_datetime is not null (ie., "closed")
